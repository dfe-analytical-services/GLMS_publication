#-----Introduction----
#"Graduate Labour Market Statistics has historically been published on GOV.UK The supporting data with worksheet titles: 
#  Headline Statistics by Year 
#  Headline Statistics 
# are generated from the files Yearly_employment_rates.csv and Yearly_salaries.csv. 

#The GLMS project that is used to make Yearly_employment_rates.csv and Yearly_salaries.csv and the corresponding rds files 
# is fround in https://dfe-gov-uk.visualstudio.com/HEFE-Higher-Education-Analysis/_git/SFM-LFS-Analysis  . The branch is GLMS_V12020

#----Description of Script----
#This scripts takes the data in Yearly_employment_rates.rds and Yearly_salaries.rds
#and puts it in the format needed for the new DfE EES platform.
# see https://rsconnect/rsc/stats-production-guidance/

#Specifically:
#(i) Employment Rates for the Time Series is found in
#    one data table and has a corresponding meta file
#(ii) Salaries for the Time Series is found in
#    one data table and has a corresponding meta file

#----What format is needs ?----
#a) .csv files. For each data file a meta data file is needed
#b) tidy data format
#c)UtF-8 file encoding


#----library----
library("dplyr")
library(plyr)
library(lubridate)


#----Upload data ----
#The outputs from the GLMS program are uploaded from the shared area
